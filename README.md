# CrudApplication
It is basic crud application using PHP &amp; MySQL (●'◡'●)


CREATE: Naturally, the app should be able to create new employee records as you onboard new members to your team. The CREATE operation can be performed by providing a form in the CRUD app that contains form fields like text, numbers, email for input and a submit button to add the new record to database so that, When we hit the submit button for our form, then a POST HTTP request would be sent to our API and add this new Recipe into the DB.



READ: This READ function should allow the end-user to see records – search for a specific employee, use filters to result in a list of employees matching the search criteria. This function does not change the information displayed, however you can further configure the action to allow next steps like update details. Most advanced tools enhance their CRUD interfaces by integrating with tools and services such as email sending tools



UPDATE: You look at the employee information and notice that their information is incomplete or outdated. The UPDATE function lets you change the information. You first edit the record, add the new information over a form interface. Next you would submit to update the database with the new information.



DELETE: Some employees have moved on from your enterprise and you realize you no longer need all their information and can remove it from the database. The DELETE function helps you remove particular records you no longer need. This can take the shape of a delete button or an “X” next to the employee record displayed on the user interface that upon clicking triggers a DELETE HTTP request and removes the record from the database.
